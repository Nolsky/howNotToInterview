# howNotToInterview
Someting isn't working here... is it me? I don't want it to be me... (A githubsplaination of what I've been up to &amp; how I believe tech hiring is broken)

Hello world!
If you are looking at the blankness of my Github history and wondering why it's because I had some life happen immediately after my time at Hack Reactor. Thankfully though it is still only a temporary condition (self-diagnosed with my Psych background. For how "useless" my degree has been rendered by my career change; it's been so amazingly useful in the grand scheme of things). And oh man- what a long strange trip it's been. 

Many interviewers are quick to notice I have "no work experience" in terms of programming. It's true, and following the "Agile Prime Directive" I can't really fault them for seeing that. Judging books by their covers is a faulty heuristic we as a society have sadly developed as a result of our broken and fragmented soceital context. Thankfully, if you ever get to know me, you may realize I love to promote the ideal of "People are people too" as stupid as it may sound -- I am nothing if not understanding. 

Here is a collection of questions I have devised that I would want to ask if I were in the interviewing the interviewer (which in an ideal world would be possible -- though because of the power dichotomy created by 'I need a job plez', it's not something achieveable quite so easily from the disadvantaged real world position of interviewee). 

Cheers,
Nolsky
