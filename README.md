Someting isn't working here... is it me? I don't want it to be me... (A githubsplaination of what I've been up to &amp; how I believe tech hiring is broken)

Hello world!
If you are looking at the blankness of my Github history and wondering why it's because I had some life happen immediately after my time at Hack Reactor. Thankfully though it is still only a temporary condition (self-diagnosed with my Psych background. For how "useless" my degree has been rednered by my career change; it's been so amazingly useful in the grand scheme of things)
